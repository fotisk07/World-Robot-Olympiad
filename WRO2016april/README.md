# WRO April 2016 - ERATOSTHENIS

Panhellenic Robotics Competition - Ancient World Theme
## Overview
Our team, Minders, developed a LEGO-based odometer inspired by Archimedes' design. The robot translates linear movement into rotational motion, allowing for precise distance measurement.

## Technical Approach
- Uses a gyroscope to track movement and ensure accuracy.
- Converts the robotâ€™s forward motion into circular rotations parallel to the ground.
- Demonstrates historical engineering principles using modern robotics.
