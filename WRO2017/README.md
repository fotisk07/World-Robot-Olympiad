# WROjuly2017 - ATLANTIS 

Panhellenic Robotics Competition - Maritime Exploration
## Overview
We designed an autonomous boat equipped with a deployable submarine that collects underwater data and transmits it via Bluetooth to a mobile app.

## Technical Approach
The boat navigates to predefined GPS coordinates.
- A mini-submarine is deployed for underwater sensing.
- Sensor readings are sent wirelessly to a mobile application.
